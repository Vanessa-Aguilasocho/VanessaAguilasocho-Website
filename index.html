          I am a current fourth year Spanish Linguistics and Education double major at the University of California, Riverside. I aspire to become an elementary school teacher at the Kindergarten level. <br><br>

As a young girl, I had always wanted to become a pediatrician. I loved kids, even when I was one myself. I wanted to impact the lives of the younger generation and for years I assumed that the only way to do so was to become a doctor. When I began my journey at the University of California, Riverside, my perspectives about life, school, and my career had changed. During my second year of university, I was inspired by a talk  that a friend of mine had given during a meeting for the organization we were a part of. This talk was a major factor in my decision to change my career. Around this same time, the university added Education as an official major, so during my third year I registered for some education courses and fell in love with it and all that education encompasses. I realized that in order to achieve my dream of impacting the lives of children in a positive manner, I would have to be in the classroom.
<br><br>
My experience in the field of education began when I myself was in elementary school. I volunteered on various occasions at the elementary school that my mother worked and continues to work for from a young age until the present. The volunteer work consisted of assisting the students with their reading and fluency skills, managing the classroom, or assisting the teacher. With my background in music, I found it important to share this knowledge with those who may not have the opportunity to, therefore I performed for various classes and inspired many students to pursue music in the fifth grade. I currently work at the Student Recreation Center (SRC) at the University of California, Riverside as an Operations Assistant and now as a Supervisor as well as a Camp Counselor for Camp Highlander. Through my experience as a Camp Counselor, I have been able to mentor the campers and scaffold a healthy lifestyle and development of critical soft skills, such as adaptability, problem-solving skills, and teamwork. Through the Spanish Linguistics major, I have developed a critical understanding of the Spanish language and various sociological components, research, and databases. My passion for the Spanish language has inspired me to  work for a dual-immersion elementary school. As an aspiring educator, it is important for me to gain an understanding of ways to implement a culturally relevant pedagogies and give back to my community. I am also currently in the process of conducting research on undergraduate students from the university on how bilingual education affects language use and perception as well as how it affects one's educational journey.
<br><br>
As I will be graduating from the University of California, Riverside in June 2020, I will be applying for the Masters in Education (M.Ed) and California teaching credentials for the 2020-2021 school year.
